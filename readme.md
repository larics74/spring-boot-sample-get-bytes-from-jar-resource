# Spring-boot-sample-get-bytes-from-jar-resource

This small app loads byte array from resource within jar file.

There were some issues with accessing resources when running Spring Boot apps from jar instead of IDE or Maven (you can find discussions on stackoverflow and Spring forums). So, this app was created just to find/check approach that will, I hope, work regardless of running method.
